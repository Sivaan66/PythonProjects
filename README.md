# PythonProjects
This repository contains all the small projects that i made through my Python learnig process. This shows my up untill knowledge about python.
Here are all codes i went through during my learning :
## Automatic File Sorting -
Automatically sort the file to specified folder according to the file type.  

-Imported OS and Shutil()  
-Specified the path.  
-Made three folders uisng os.makedirs()  
-Took three types of files as reference - ".jpg", ".pdf", ".csv"  
-Then created three folders named - "image", "pdf", "sql"  
-Then i used shutil.move(scr,dst) to move those files to their specified folders.

## Treasure Hunt Path -
A coding problem where you calculate the final position on a grid map after a series of movement instructions (U-up, D-down, L-left, R-right).  
  
-The starting point is at (0, 0), and the task is to follow the instructions to determine the final coordinates.  
-Each time the movement will be for only one unit in the map.
-If i say RRLDUR, means the coordinates will be at (2,0) = (x,y)
